# Expansion template

## Introduction

Basic empty Konsool expansion, with te correct dimensions between the connector and the mounting holes.

## Orientation

The board oriention is seen from the front of the Konsool.
- Front on the PCB will point inwards, hence towards the konsool.
- Back of the PCB will be pointing outwards

Any high components or components that need user interaction need to be placed an the back side of the PCB.

# Outline

That the outline is kept smaller than the outline of the Konsool PCB, this is done so there is
room for the housing to wrap around the board. 
The board edge can be modified as needed, given a custom housing needs to be designed in most cases.

# Features

- Connector

# Requirements

- Imagination
